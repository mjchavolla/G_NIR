# GAIA-NIR Spectra Simulation
This project will simulate the proposed GAIA-NIR spectrometer to derive radial velocities.

## Goals
- Build a pipeline for the GAIA-NIR spectrometer simulation.

## Repository Structure
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data analysis and simulation.
- `data/`: Spectra and other input datasets.
- `results/`: Output plots and derived data.
